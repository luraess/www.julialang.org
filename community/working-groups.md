## Working Groups

A working group is a group of people that are interested in working on a common
topic. Working groups are informal and have no official authority. All working
groups have a public channel on the [Julia Slack][slack]. Many working groups
also hold regular meetings that are held online and are open to anyone. Meeting
links are posted in the relevant Slack channels.

The working group meetings are also listed on the
[community events calendar][commmunity-events-calendar].

### Triage call

In addition to working groups, the Julia community also holds regular triage calls
to discuss open issues and pull requests. Unlike working groups, the triage calls
tend to discuss a wider range of topics. Triage calls are held online and are open
to anyone. Please check Slack for the meeting link.
